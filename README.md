###### 1. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
let greeting;
greetign = {};
console.log(greetign);
```

- A: `{}`
- B: `ReferenceError: greetign is not defined`
- C: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A: `{}`

<i>The greeting variable is declared globally and assigned an empty object. The typo in the variable name does not affect the output of the code snippet, because the let keyword creates a new binding for the variable each time it is declared. When the value of the greeting variable is logged to the console, the output is an empty object ({}).</i>

###### 2. Write the `correct nswer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

sum(1, "2");
```

- A: `NaN`
- B: `TypeError`
- C: `"12"`
- D: `3`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B: `TypeError`

<i>The sum() function expects two numbers as arguments, but the second argument in the code snippet is a string. JavaScript cannot add a string to a number, so the function throws a TypeError exception.</i>

###### 3. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
const food = ["🍕", "🍫", "🥑", "🍔"];
const info = { favoriteFood: food[0] };

info.favoriteFood = "🍝";

console.log(food);
```

- A: `['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- B: `['🍝', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- C: `['🍝', '🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A: ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔'].

<i>The const keyword prevents the food variable from being reassigned. When the info.favoriteFood property is changed, the food array is not affected. Therefore, the output of the code snippet is ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔'].</i>

###### 4. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
function sayHi(name) {
  return `Hi there, ${name}`;
}

console.log(sayHi());
```

- A: `Hi there,`
- B: `Hi there, undefined`
- C: `Hi there, null`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B: Hi there, undefined.

<i>The sayHi() function expects a name as an argument, but the code snippet does not pass any arguments to the function. Therefore, the name parameter is set to undefined and the output of the function is "Hi there, undefined".</i>

</p>
</details>

###### 5. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
let count = 0;
const nums = [0, 1, 2, 3];

nums.forEach((num) => {
  if (num) count += 1;
});

console.log(count);
```

- A: 1
- B: 2
- C: 3
- D: 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C : 3 ; 

<i>The forEach() method iterates over the elements of an array and executes a callback function for each element. The callback function increments the count variable if the current element of the array is non-zero. There are three non-zero elements in the nums array, so the output of the code snippet is 3.</i>
